# NDVI_Calc
Work connected to Cubesat Project
This was a section of the Cubesat project I was responsible for in which I had to use the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index(NDVI).
Purpose was to take a grayscaled image and run an NDVI calculation on it to reveal high risk areas of potetial wildfires.
